# Project 01: Color Inverter
**Description**: The user will place down RGB values. After submitting the values, a new color value will be returned, with this new value being the inverted version of the color you placed.

**What I'm Testing**: I've never made a full-blown GUI before. After all my time of using Python, I've been using the console, and those weren't cool CLI apps either. So, I'll be _experimenting with Tkinter_. I'll be using it for a few projects while I learn the ropes of the module, starting with this.
