# My 2026 Python Path
One of my New Year’s Resolutions for 2026 is to become good at Python enough to have it automate various tasks in my life. I’ve been using the language on and off now for about a few years, and even had AI do all the scripting and coding for me, but I figured it was about time I decide to fully master the language as I relearn some old concepts and learn newer concepts I’ve never learned before.

Throughout all of 2026, I will have to make one project for every **two weeks**. Near the end of that project’s timeline, I will reflect on myself using this neat template from the awesome article [by AlgoCademy](https://algocademy.com/blog/how-practice-alone-wont-make-you-better-the-role-of-reflection-in-problem-solving/).

```md
Reflection Template:
1. **Problem Summary**: [Brief description of the problem]
2. **My Approach**: [Steps taken to solve the problem]
3. **Challenges Faced**: [List of difficulties encountered]
4. **Key Learnings**: [New concepts or techniques learned]
5. **Future Applications**: [How this learning can be applied to other problems]
6. **Areas for Improvement**: [Skills or concepts to focus on next]
```

I will use AI as a tutor to help me reflect and answer a lot of my somewhat specific questions, but I will **NEVER** have AI write me a _single_ line of code throughout my 2026 path.

I’m a little shy to make this public as there will be a lot of rookie mistakes and terrible code for the world to see, but I think it’s worth it. Not only will I see myself slowly improve, but so will others. You’re free to message me on any of my socials or submit a pull request to let me know of concepts I should know to improve, or if just feel like flaming my code (I wouldn’t blame you).
