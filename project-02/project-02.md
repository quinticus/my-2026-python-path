# Project #2: File Transfer
**Start Date**: 1/18/26
**Due Date**: 1/31/26

**Description**: The user selects a folder in their device/peripheral. Then, they have the choice to select a file or multiple files from there. Then they have three choices: Move To, Copy To, and Delete. Delete is self-explanatory, but selecting Move or Copy To will have the user type a different path to then transfer the selected file(s) to that path.

**Background Info**: Almost every week, I have to move files from one folder to another within a USB manually. It used to take minutes but I've gotten good enough to do it in about a minute or less. There are most likely many tools that can do this for me, but it'd be cooler if I coded this myself. If this works amazingly, I'll make this a separate 

**What I'm testing**: Multiple modules for working with files and the system (OS, PathLib, Shutil), and Rich to make a neat-looking terminal application.
