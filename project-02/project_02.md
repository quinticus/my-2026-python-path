# Project #2: File Transfer
**Start Date**: 1/18/26

**Due Date**: 1/31/26

**Description**: The user selects a folder in their device/peripheral. Then, they have the choice to select a file or multiple files from there. Then they have three choices: Move To, Copy To, and Delete. Delete is self-explanatory, but selecting Move or Copy To will have the user type a different path to then transfer the selected file(s) to that path.

**Background Info**: Almost every week, I have to move files from one folder to another within a USB manually. It used to take minutes but I've gotten good enough to do it in about a minute or less. There are most likely many tools that can do this for me, but it'd be cooler if I coded this myself. If this works amazingly, I'll make this a separate repository.

**What I'm testing**: Multiple modules for working with files and the system (OS, PathLib, Shutil), and Rich to make a neat-looking CLI.
## Reflection
1. **Problem Summary**: For the most part, this proejct had went smoothly with minimal setback and issue. At most, I had to maneuver my way around the documentation around Questionary and watch my variables.

2. **My Approach**: I had decided to modularize my code so that all the functions aren't in the same one Python file. This, alongside keeping track of the returned varibles, was a massive help.

3. **Challenges Faced**: Not related to the code but more to how long I code. I would work on the code for the first few days before stopping as they are "complete."

4. **Key Learnings**: Modularizing my code managed to make my code far more readable, as I can trace back to what each function does easily. Explicitly delcaring the variable and return types, even if I already know what type they are/will be, managed to help me keep track of what is what more easily.

5. **Future Applications**: Different types of functions should be modularized into their own files (like how there are dedicated functions for [the interface](./interface.py) and [the logic itself](./logic.py)).

6. **Areas for Improvement**: Not entirely related to the code, but I have to focus on adding more onto my programs when I "finished" the code. Ever since I finished not only this but the last project, I haven't touched it ever since up until the project end-date.

**Overall Thoughts**: I haven't quite learned very much from this project, simply for the fact that I haven't touched this ever since I completed this early on, _and_ because I skimming through documentation to understand (and having used the AI a little bit too much for this to help guide me). The next project will focus on something that I will be using a lot throughout my jouney, and be something actually difficult so I can better learn.
